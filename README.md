# Python Project Setup: A Step-by-Step Guide to Industry Best Practices

This guid will help you to setup and kickstart your python project. And all the nitty-gritty details of which tools to use and how to configure them together, through building a simple CLI.

## Tools used

- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv): python version manager
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): python package manager
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): automating checks on your local
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/): python testing framework
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): CI/CD tool. Automates checks (like pre-commit) on the server side as well.
- [Actions python](https://github.com/armand-sauzay/actions-python): A set of actions (Lint, Test and Release) to use with python projects.

# Software Design Guide

This repository aims at defining a set of practices to improve your code. Some
rules are general and some apply to specific programming languages.

## General Code Principles

Here are a few principles that mostly are language agnostic and that can help improve your code:

- **Lint**
  - Find a set of rules to write code and try to abide by it or enforce it (through pre-commit for instance).
  - Include linting as part of your CI.
- **Test**
  - As a general rule try to write as much test code as actual code.
  - Include testing as part of your CI.
- **Release**
  - Your code should have releases and versioning.
  - You can use semantic versioning.
- **Document**
  - Document your code.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).**
  - Itâ€™s ok to write code once or twice (maybe). But more than this you should change the implementation
- **Premature abstraction is as dangerous as premature optimization**
  - Don't try to abstract too early.
  - Don't try to optimize too early.
- **Focus on readability**
  - Non readable code translates to non-maintainable code, so it should not be long before it is useless.
  - Document your code.
  - Use descriptive and meaningful variable and function names
  - Limit nesting
    - "if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program." - Linus Torvalds (in relation with 8 space indentation for the linux kernel style)
    - Use extraction: when a subpart of your code becomes too large, extract it and turn it into its own function.
    - Use inversion: limit conditions and put the "unhappy" first (for instance, an if statement for a failing clause and then the actual function without an else indentation)
- **Think about building blocks in your code**
  - Consider inputs, outputs and transformations. Times the number of operations you have in your code.
  - Your code should be a sequence of blocks that you can then arrange.
  - Each of your block should have a
  - Optimize each block. And then the overall workflow (unit tests, integration tests)
  - Each of your block should be cohesive: each module, class, or function has a single, well-defined purpose, and the code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain.
